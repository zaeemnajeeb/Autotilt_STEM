# Autotilt_STEM
Diamond Year in Industry project (Sep 2021 - Sep 2022) where scripts were written in Digital Micrograph using the in-built coding language (Scripting) which is similar to C++.

Report summarising work is contained within 'AutoTilt_to_Zone_Report.pdf'

The 2 videos below showcase the effect of the script. In the first video, an experienced used reorients a ZSM-5 sample until the beam is oriented down the Zone Axis (located initially at the top of the viewing image). This took the experienced user approximately 6.5 minutes, where an inexeprienced user quickly lost the sample in the process. The video is at 10x speed, where it should be noted how drastic the stage moves after small changes in tilt.

The second video (edited with VEED.IO) showcases an inexperienced user using the created scripts to automatically tilt and then apply stage corrections to the sample. This took approximately 2 minutes and is 3.25 times faster than manual reorientation. Note how the beam is also blanked throughout, further reducing any beam damage to the sample.

The below Figure presented at EMAG 2022 further demonstrates this, where the scripts were used on a MoO<sub>3</sub> sample. The centre of the optic axis is marked by a red circle. (A) shows a crystal, outlined in green, oriented off zone. (B) shows the image after tilting, note how the crystal has moved outside the field of view. (C) shows how, after automated stage position correction, the crystal returns to the centre of the image and oriented now on the zone axis.
